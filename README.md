# Phong - A Pong remake with more JUICE

Here is the website for this repository: https://amoghsubhedar.github.io/des315Phong
<br>A playable version of the game is hosted on that.

## About
This repository contains a unity project which I made for a class where the objective of the assignment was to take a classic arcade game and add some game feel elements to it.
I uploaded this project to github so that I could use workflows to create a CI pipeline. Every change committed to the main branch will fire a container that builds a WebGL build of the unity project, commits the build to another branch and hosts it using github pages.

## Branches
- main  : Contains all the files and assets required to build a unity project
- builds: WebGL build of the most recent unity project built from main. This branch acts as the backend for the repo's github pages.
- backup/release: Older branches that were used to test unity builder.

## Status
- ![main workflow](https://github.com/AmoghSubhedar/des315Phong/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?main)
- ![backup workflow](https://github.com/AmoghSubhedar/des315Phong/actions/workflows/backup.yml/badge.svg?backup)
